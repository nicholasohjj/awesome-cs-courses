### Contributing

Have a few courses in mind that you think are awesome and would fit in this list? Feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/nicholasohjj/awesome-cs-courses/pulls).

### Submission Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your course meets all of the following criteria:

- ✅ Course must be a university CS course
- ✅ Must have freely accessible materials (lectures, assignments, exams, etc.)
- ✅ Must not be from:
  - MOOCs (Coursera, edX, Udacity, etc.)
  - MIT OCW (ocw.mit.edu)
- ✅ Prefer lesser-known / non-hyped courses

**Note:** Submissions from ocw.mit.edu are out of scope for this list and will not be accepted.

### Formatting Guidelines

Follow the format used in existing entries in [README.md](README.md) (title – description – icons). When adding new courses:

- **Alphabetization**: When adding new courses to the various categories, please ensure that alphabetization (ex. CSCE 48 should be listed after CS 240) is maintained. This makes it easier for viewers to find what they are looking for.
- **Icons**: Next to each course title, you'll notice a few icons. These icons serve to let readers know, at a quick glance, what materials they can expect to find at the courses' websites. The meanings of these icons are explained in the [Legend](README.md#legend) section of README.md, and also appear as a tooltip whenever you hover over them with your mouse arrow. The code needed to add these tags is easily found in [README.md](README.md), so you can just copy and paste as needed.
- **Sublinks**: When adding sublinks under a course (such as "Lecture Videos", "Assignments", etc.), only include them if they point to a **different website** than the main course link. Do not add sublinks that point to the same website/domain as the course link, as this is redundant and clutters the list.

### Review Process

I might not merge every suggestion; courses are accepted at the maintainer's discretion. This list focuses on relatively unknown university CS courses with freely accessible materials, as there are services like [ClassCentral](https://www.class-central.com/) doing a great job of aggregating popular courses.
