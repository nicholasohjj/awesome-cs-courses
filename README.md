## Contributing

### A couple of things to keep in mind:

- When adding new courses to the various categories, please ensure that alphabetization (ex. CSCE 48 should be listed after CS 240) is maintained. This makes it easier for viewers to find what they are looking for.
- Next to each course title, you'll notice a few icons. These icons serve to let readers know, at a quick glance, what materials they can expect to find at the courses' websites. The meanings of these icons are explained in the [Legend](#legend) section above.
